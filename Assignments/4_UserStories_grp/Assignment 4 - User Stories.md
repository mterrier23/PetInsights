### User Stories: 
1.	As an animal shelter representative, I want to upload our shelter’s needs so that users can see what to donate.
2.	As a user looking to adopt, I want to enter my pet preferences so that I can view animals that match my preferences.
3.	As a user looking to adopt, I want to modify my distance preferences so that I can see animal shelters that are in my desired radius.
4.	As a general user + volunteer, I want to upload pictures and comments about dogs I interact with at the shelters, so that other users can find a better match.
5.	As an animal shelter representative, I want to signify that we are accepting volunteers, so that people can apply to volunteer and help us out.
6.	As a user looking to foster animals, I want to get notifications about new rescues and other animals that need to be fostered. 
7.	As a general user/volunteer, I want access to information about the shelter’s needs, so that I can help them in the best way possible. 
8.	As an animal shelter representative, I want more people to see what animals are available for adoption, so they are more likely to be adopted. 
9.	As an animal shelter representative, I want an easy way of putting our information across, so that it’s not too much extra work for me. 
10.	As a user, I would like to have my own account/ profile where all my preferences and comments are stored. This would also be where animal shelter representatives can contact me if need be.
