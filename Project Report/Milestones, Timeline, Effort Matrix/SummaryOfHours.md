5 hours per week * 15 weeks = 75 general hours on overall project work. 
A majority of my fall semester time was spent on drawing UI prototypes to get an idea of the application architecture and flow.
3 hours in total were for researching the database to use for our project.
5 hours in total were for finding and deciding on a framework to develop on.

### Spring Semester
Weeks 1-7 of the semester saw 6 hours a week spent on developing, this accounts for at least 42 hours.
The remaining weeks until the project due date saw 2-3 hours each day, this accounts for at least 108 hours.
The majority of these hours were spent on setting up the database of the application, setting up the architecture of the application, and developing the features assigned to me of the application. 
I also spent many of these hours doing Project Management duties such as rearranging our backlog, adding new user stories, and checking up on team members.

For this project, I had a combination of responsibilities. I worked on the UI (low fidelity as some high fidelity screens), developed a few features out in the app as well as did some logo design. For all the UI development, I went through a iterative design process.

I also worked on developing certain features for the app, like the front end design for many of the screens, and hacking through Xamarin to get the result we wanted. This was the first time working with Xamarin as well as mobile app development, so I did a lot of research and troubleshooting in the development process as well.
