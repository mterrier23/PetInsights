Your group will produce a table indicating a breakdown of how much effort each group member will apply to each task. You can provide percentage of effort or hours of effort; the goal is to create a table that meaningfully represents your expected division of labor for all tasks. As indicated in your task list, there should be a team member identified who is of primary responsibility for each task.
