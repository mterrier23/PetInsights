# Constraints

Below we discuss some possible constraints related to our project.

## Economic Costs
Our database will be rather large as we continue to collect crowd-sources media and comments, along with the profile information of all our users and organizations. The current free solutions for databases don’t have a large enough capability for what we want to achieve.

A key part of our solution is to integrate a Map API. Economic costs also factor into this as free or open source solutions have a higher learning curve and are not as good as Google Maps.

## Time
Considering that we are rather busy during our college semesters, it may be difficult to put aside enough time for this project to reach the milestones we have set. If we didn’t have so many other courses simultaneously that each require a lot of effort, we wouldn’t have this issue.

All of us are also in the midst of figuring out our “next steps” – either grad school or full-time jobs. This make juggling our responsibilities a lot harder, but the yearlong setup is incredibly helpful.

## Scope
Our project has a rather large scope, however, we were able to breakdown our project into multiple “stages” and decided that for the sake of the senior design deadline, we won’t pressure ourselves to reach all the stages. However, we still want to reach a stage that results in a fully functional app, just with not all the features we want.

We have split the goals into minimum and stretch features. Depending on interest, relevance, and time, these will be implemented

## Professional/Technical
Our project does involve a lot of specialized skill; however, we feel confident that we will be able to overcome this learning curve and still provide an impressive product.

## Ethical and Legal
None that we know of. Since there are legal processes involved in adoption, we might run into some, but we plan to handoff the adoption process to shelters and just act as the middlemen of making the connection, not the data.
 There is also a huge need to store location and contact information of our users securely.

## Environmental
Potential adopters do not have to drive around to the nearby shelters to “check” what animals they have. Our application has the potential to help the environment in small ways.
