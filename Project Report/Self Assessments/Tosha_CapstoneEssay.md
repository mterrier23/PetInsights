# Individual Capstone Assessment
### 14.09.2020


My senior design project is an application focused on **improving the adoption process at local animal shelters** and bridging the gap between adopters and the animals.

Through my collegiate experience, I have developed an intersecting interest in technology and people - which naturally led me to human computer interaction as a field. In order to further my experience, I will be leading the user experience and interface side of the project. The application will go through a well defined user research and customer focused design process so users don’t face as many obstacles while finding their dream animal. I am hoping to develop my skills as a UX professional and a design leader through this project to prepare for job after graduation. In addition to this, I am looking forward to improving my development knowledge as we code out this application.



My team and I believe that we will be successful in the development of our project because of what we have learned through our courses and co-ops. In my case, I learned a lot about basic programming in my Intro to Python (CS) course where we did projects using python to build whatever we wanted. This was my first experience of bringing an idea to life from start to finish. I also took a class called Software Engineering that helped me visualize web applications in terms of their data architecture which should allow us to properly structure our application. I am also taking a CS Elective on Intro to User Interface that should help guide us on creating a user-centric experience in our project.



In addition to academics, I also gained application development experience from my co-ops at David J Joseph Company, where I participated in different parts of the development cycle. Since our application will be collecting user information, security will be of utmost importance, and I will be able to draw from my time researching at Dr. Niu’s lab about security vulnerabilities. However, I think my last co-op at Mitsubishi Fuso, Japan will support me the most in terms of team-work and human focused interfaces. I worked as a Human Machine Interface Intern in an R&D team on various projects focused on market and user research. All these experiences combined should help lead the success of our project.



This project is very exciting to me for many reasons. I have volunteered a couple of times for SAAP, a local shelter, that does a great job finding homes for orphaned animals. I loved the work that they do, so being able to support them in any way possible is good enough motivation for me. In addition to doing good for the community, this project also aligns with my professional goals - which is the perfect combination.



We will spend the first phase of our project doing research on the obstacles shelters and people looking to adopt face. Once we have discovered the problems needed to be solved, we will begin prototyping what basic features the web application will have. The next few phases will consist of iterative development, after which we will add more features if we have time and resources to do so.
