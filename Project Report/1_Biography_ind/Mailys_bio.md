## Co-op Work Experience	
#### Data Analyst & Project Manager, *Daimler  Mitsubishi FUSO*
February 2020 - August 2020  
* Worked with various local and global teams to enable customer data collection of ADAS Emergency Braking events from all FUSO vehicles for analysis. Only customers who have complied with data-sharing will be included.
* Performed data analysis using Power BI to identify ADAS event hotspots and improve testing routes by targeting these hotspots.
* Found that we are able to detect quality issues early and reduce testing efforts as the collective mileage that is driven by the customers is 100x more than what we cover in testing. Higher exposure to performance issues.
* Applied my project management skills that I learned in my previous internship.
		
#### Software Engineer & Project Manager, *Microsoft*
May 2019 - August 2019
* As Project Manager, researched and designed solutions to reduce the 10% of candidates who do not complete the reimbursement process with Microsoft, averaging 300 USD each.
* Partnered across teams to drive awareness and clarity and to build support of the project among stakeholders and engineering teams.
* Developed the solution, with a focus on authentication and front-end development, to enhance and unify the candidate reimbursement experience and work towards the One Microsoft vision.
* Learned through this experience that I want to pursue a career in Project Management after gaining experience in Software Engineering.
		
#### Software Developer, *Worldpay*
August 2018 - December 2018
* Added features to the billing process of payment transactions to support the usage of gift cards and Mastercard credit cards.
* Led my own feature and handled six user stories every two-week sprint while performing Agile Development Methodologies.
* Learned how to work with people in different time-zones. Half of my teammates at Worldpay were located in Bangalore, India, which is 10:30 hours ahead of Cincinnati, Ohio. It was neat learning that my project manager addressed the time difference by scheduling our stand-ups at 7:30 AM EST (6:00 PM IST) to accommodate our coworkers as much as possible.	
	
#### Software Developer, *TechSolve Inc.*
January 2018 - May 2018
* Enhanced the functionalities and capabilities of a data management software related to IoT according to customer needs.
* Maintained a C++ and C# version of said software.
* My first experience working as a professional. At first, it was difficult working in an all-male department with an age gap of at least 12 years, but I eventually adapted and figured that I wouldn't get anywhere if I didn't ask for help.
## Areas of Interest
Through my internships, I have become interested in figuring out how to best store data (database management). I also am interested in full-stack development, because as much as I enjoy front-end development and UX, I also like to be involved in the connecting point between this and the back-end.
 
If I didn't go into Computer Science, I would have pursued a veterinarian degree as I have a huge love for animals. However, over time I realized that I can still use my computer science degree to make positive changes to animals' lives.

A subject area I haven't yet explored but am very interested in is IoT. I would love to do a project related to wearable technology!

## Project Sought
* Animal-related
* IoT-related
* Customer-focused
